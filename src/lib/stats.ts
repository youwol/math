 * A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean; high
 * standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a large range of values.
 *
 * The standard deviation of a random variable, statistical population, data set, or probability distribution
 * is the square root of its variance. It is algebraically simpler though practically less robust
 * than the average absolute deviation. A useful property of standard deviation is that, unlike
 * variance, it is expressed in the same units as the data.

 * is the 1st Quartile subtracted from the 3rd Quartile; these quartiles can be clearly
